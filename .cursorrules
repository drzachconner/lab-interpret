# BiohackLabs.ai - Project Overview

## What We're Building
A lab ordering platform with AI interpretation that integrates with Fullscript's API.

## Core Functionality

### Lab Ordering
- Sync and display ALL Fullscript labs
- Smart bundling algorithm (group by lab provider + sample type to minimize draw fees)
- Shopping cart interface
- Create Fullscript treatment plan via API
- Redirect to Fullscript for checkout
- Fullscript handles: pricing, discounts, payment, fulfillment, commission

### Lab Interpretation Service
- $19 fee for AI interpretation (our only direct payment)
- Pricing structure:
  - Upload existing labs: $19 for interpretation
  - Order new labs: Optional $19 add-on for interpretation
  - One $19 fee covers ALL labs in a session (multiple panels/uploads)
- We process payment for interpretation only (Stripe)
- Generate comprehensive biohacking-focused analysis
- Use functional/optimal ranges, not just standard ranges
- Include supplement protocol with Fullscript links

### Supplement Display
- Link to Fullscript dispensary for full catalog
- API pull popular products for showcase
- No inventory, no direct sales - all through Fullscript

### Automation Flow
1. Labs ordered → Fullscript handles payment/fulfillment
2. Results ready → Webhook triggers our AI interpretation
3. Email with dashboard link
4. Interactive dashboard with recommendations
5. Follow-up emails for retesting reminders

## Current State
- Recently migrated from Lovable.ai (remove unnecessary code)
- Supabase backend configured
- MCP connection established
- Need: Fullscript API integration
- Open to UI/UX improvements

## Technical Stack (Open to Improvements)
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- Integrations: Fullscript API, OpenAI, Resend, Stripe (interpretation only)
- Deployment: Vercel

## What to Ignore/Remove
- Direct lab payment processing (Fullscript handles)
- Supplement inventory management
- Complex pricing logic (comes from Fullscript)
- Overly complex features from Lovable era

## Immediate Tasks
1. Sync Fullscript lab catalog
2. Build smart bundling algorithm
3. Create lab browsing UI
4. Setup Stripe for $19 interpretation fee
5. Clean up unnecessary code

## Key Mental Model
We build: UI/UX, lab browsing, smart bundling, AI interpretation
We handle payment for: $19 interpretation fee only
Fullscript handles: All lab payments, supplement sales, pricing, discounts, fulfillment
We receive: Commission from Fullscript (they handle this entirely)

## Additional Context
- Focus on functional medicine and biohacking approach
- Use leading edge functional ranges, not just standard lab ranges
- Emphasize holistic health awareness
- Create highly interactive AI interpretations
- Include diet, lifestyle, and supplement recommendations
- Provide direct Fullscript links for all supplement suggestions
- Email automation for lab reminders and supplement refills
- Dashboard for users to view their lab interpretations and recommendations
