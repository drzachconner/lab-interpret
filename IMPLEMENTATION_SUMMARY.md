```

### Step 2: Environment Variables (5 min)
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zhdjvfylxgtiphldjtqf/settings/functions

Add these secrets:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_KEY
# or
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-YOUR_KEY

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY
FULLSCRIPT_DISPENSARY_ID=drzachconner
FULLSCRIPT_PRACTITIONER_NAME=Dr. Zach Conner
AI_PROVIDER=openai  # or 'anthropic'
```

### Step 3: Deploy Updated Edge Function (10 min)
```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed:
supabase functions deploy analyze-labs

# Or manually upload via Dashboard:
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zhdjvfylxgtiphldjtqf/functions
```

### Step 4: Test the System (10 min)
1. Start your dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit: http://localhost:5173

3. Test with sample data:
   - Upload a PDF or use test data
   - Complete Stripe payment (use test card 4242...)
   - View AI analysis with supplement recommendations

## ðŸ’° Revenue Architecture

### Direct Revenue
- **$19 per analysis** via Stripe
- Automated payment processing
- Instant analysis delivery

### Passive Revenue
- **25-35% commission** on supplements via Fullscript
- Automatic tracking of clicks and conversions
- No inventory or fulfillment needed

### Tracking Metrics
```sql
-- Monitor your revenue
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_analyses,
  COUNT(*) * 19 as revenue_from_analyses,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Track supplement engagement
SELECT 
  supplement_name,
  COUNT(*) as recommendations,
  SUM(CASE WHEN clicked THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clicks,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN clicked THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as click_rate
FROM supplement_tracking
GROUP BY supplement_name
ORDER BY recommendations DESC;
```
