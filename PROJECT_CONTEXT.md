# BiohackLabs.ai - Project Context & Current Status

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED
**Storage Bucket Missing**: The `lab-results` storage bucket needs to be created in Supabase before uploads will work.

## Project Overview
This is a simplified AI-powered lab interpretation platform that analyzes uploaded lab results using functional medicine principles and provides personalized supplement recommendations with automatic 25% practitioner discounts through Fullscript.

## Current Development Status
- ✅ **Application is running** at http://localhost:5173
- ✅ **User authentication working** (email/password + Google OAuth)
- ✅ **UI/UX complete** - All pages built and styled
- ✅ **File upload interface working** - Drag & drop and file picker both functional
- ❌ **Storage bucket missing** - Need to create `lab-results` bucket in Supabase
- ❌ **Database tables not created** - Need to run migrations
- ❌ **Edge functions not deployed** - Need to deploy analyze-labs function
- ❌ **Stripe not configured** - Need product ID
- ❌ **AI service not connected** - Need API keys

## What Was Just Fixed
1. Fixed vite.config.ts to use correct plugin
2. Fixed Dashboard.tsx file upload functionality (drag & drop now works)
3. Application successfully running on localhost:5173

## Required Immediate Setup

### 1. Create Storage Bucket in Supabase
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('lab-results', 'lab-results', false);

-- Create storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload lab results" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'lab-results' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own lab results" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'lab-results' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

### 2. Create Database Tables
Run the migration file: `supabase/migrations/001_simplified_schema.sql`

### 3. Deploy Edge Function
```bash
supabase functions deploy analyze-labs
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
The `.env` file exists but needs these values updated:
- VITE_STRIPE_INTERPRETATION_PRICE_ID (create $19 product in Stripe)
- OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (for AI analysis)

### 5. Update Fullscript URL
Edit `src/pages/Analysis.tsx` line 11:
```typescript
const FULLSCRIPT_DISPENSARY_URL = "https://us.fullscript.com/welcome/drzachconner";
```

## Supabase Project Details
- **Project URL**: https://zhdjvfylxgtiphldjtqf.supabase.co
- **Anon Key**: Already configured in src/integrations/supabase/client.ts
- **Status**: Connected but missing storage bucket and tables

## Business Logic Flow
1. User uploads lab PDF → `lab-results` storage bucket
2. Creates order record → `orders` table
3. Redirects to Stripe payment → $19 charge
4. On success → Triggers AI analysis edge function
5. AI analyzes labs → Stores in `lab_analyses` table
6. Shows interactive report → Links to Fullscript supplements

## Key Features Implemented
✅ Custom AI branding (no mention of GPT/Claude)
✅ Beautiful interactive visual reports
✅ Health score visualizations
✅ Biomarker charts with optimal ranges
✅ Priority-tagged supplement recommendations
✅ Direct Fullscript dispensary links
✅ Responsive drag & drop file upload

## Revenue Model
- **Direct**: $19 per analysis
- **Passive**: 25-35% commission on supplement purchases through Fullscript
- **Recurring**: Users typically retest every 3-6 months

## Testing Account
Currently logged in user can test the full flow once database and storage are set up.

## Next Steps for Cursor
1. Create the storage bucket (see SQL above)
2. Run database migrations
3. Set up Stripe product and get price ID
4. Add OpenAI/Anthropic API key
5. Deploy edge function
6. Test complete flow: Upload → Pay → Analyze → View Report

## Important Notes
- AI is branded as "proprietary functional medicine AI"
- Fullscript handles patient signup automatically when they click supplement links
- The app is currently running successfully on localhost:5173
- All UI/UX is complete and polished
- Just needs backend services connected
