# BiohackLabs.ai - Functional Medicine AI Lab Analysis

A sophisticated platform that uses proprietary AI trained in functional medicine to analyze lab results and provide personalized supplement recommendations with automatic 25% practitioner discounts.

## üß¨ Our Unique Approach

Unlike standard lab interpretation that only flags disease states, our custom-trained AI evaluates your biomarkers against **functional medicine ranges** - the optimal zones for peak performance, not just "normal" ranges.

### What Makes Our AI Different:
- **Functional Medicine Trained**: Analyzes based on optimal ranges, not disease ranges
- **Biohacking Optimized**: Identifies opportunities for enhancement beyond "normal"
- **Holistic Analysis**: Considers interconnected body systems
- **Personalized Protocols**: Generates targeted supplement recommendations
- **Beautiful Reports**: Interactive visual analysis, not boring PDFs

## üíä Fullscript Integration

When users click on supplement recommendations:
1. They're directed to your Fullscript dispensary
2. Fullscript automatically prompts them to create a patient account
3. They get instant 25% discount on all purchases
4. You earn 25-35% commission on all sales

**No complex API integration needed** - Fullscript handles the signup flow natively!

## üöÄ Quick Start
