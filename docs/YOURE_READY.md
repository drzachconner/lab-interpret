## 💡 Power Commands for BiohackLabs

### Medical Features:
```
"I need to add support for Comprehensive Metabolic Panel interpretation"
```

### API Integration:
```
"Test the Fullscript API integration and show me any issues"
```

### Code Quality:
```

## 🎓 Using Context7 (Latest Docs)

Context7 gets the latest documentation for libraries:

```
"use context7 - what are the new Next.js 14 app router features?"
```

```
"use context7 - best practices for Supabase auth in Next.js"
```

```
"use context7 - OpenAI GPT-4 prompt engineering techniques"
```

---

## 🧠 Using Sequential Thinking

For complex problems, activate deeper thinking:

```
"think harder about the optimal data structure for storing lab results over time"
```

```
"Think step by step: How should we architect the supplement recommendation engine?"
```

---

## 🐙 GitHub Commands (Now Available!)

Since GitHub MCP is connected:

### Check Issues:
```
"List all open issues in the BiohackLabs repo"
```

### Create PR:
```
"Create a pull request for this feature"
```

### View Commits:
```
"Show me the last 10 commits"
```

### Create Issue:
```
"Create an issue for: Add thyroid panel support"
```

---

## 📁 File Operations

### Read Files:
```
"Read the package.json file"
"Show me the Fullscript integration code"
```

### Create Files:
```
"Create a new component for lab result display"
```

### Update Files:
```
"Update the OpenAI prompts to be more specific"
```

### Search:
```
"Find all files that use the Supabase client"
```

---

## 🎯 Example Workflow: Adding a New Feature

```
You: "Read the CLAUDE.md file"

Claude: [Reads and understands BiohackLabs context]

You: "I need to add support for interpreting Lipid Panels"

Claude: "Let me think through this step by step..."

You: "use context7 - what are the standard lipid panel markers?"

Claude: [Gets latest medical reference data]

You: "Create the TypeScript types and integration"

Claude: [Creates files with proper types]

You: "/add-tests"

Claude: [Generates comprehensive tests]

You: "/code-review"

Claude: [Reviews for quality, security, HIPAA compliance]

You: "Looks good! Create a PR for this"

Claude: [Uses GitHub MCP to create PR]
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Claude Code Doesn't Start:
```bash
# Check installation
claude --version

# Run diagnostics
claude doctor

# Check MCP servers
claude mcp list
```

### If MCP Servers Won't Connect:
This is normal! They connect when Claude Code is running and needs them.

### If GitHub Commands Don't Work:
```bash
# Verify GitHub MCP is added
claude mcp list | grep github

# If not listed, re-add:
claude mcp add github -s user -e GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

## 📚 All Your Documentation

On your Desktop:
- **YOURE_READY.md** ← You are here!
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** ← Print this! Daily reference
- **BIOHACKLABS_COMPLETE_SETUP.md** ← Full setup guide
- **ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md** ← Environment variables

## 💪 Best Practices

### Always Do This:
1. ✅ Start in your project directory
2. ✅ Let Claude read CLAUDE.md first
3. ✅ Use `/code-review` before commits
4. ✅ Use `context7` for latest docs
5. ✅ Think step-by-step for complex logic
6. ✅ Keep medical accuracy paramount

### Never Do This:
1. ❌ Commit API keys
2. ❌ Skip code review for medical features
3. ❌ Make medical claims without sources
4. ❌ Skip HIPAA compliance checks
5. ❌ Deploy without testing
