# 🧹 Desktop Cleanup - Complete!

## ✅ What Just Happened:

All your Claude Code documentation files have been **moved** (not copied) from Desktop to the lab-interpret project.

---

## 📁 New File Organization:

### **Project Root:**
```
~/Projects/lab-interpret/
├── CLAUDE.md                    ← Main setup guide for Claude Code
└── docs/                        ← All other documentation
    ├── QUICK_REFERENCE.md       ← Daily reference (print this!)
    ├── ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md       ← Environment variables guide
    ├── INSTALLATION_CHECKLIST.md
    ├── GITHUB_TOKEN_SETUP.md
    ├── YOURE_READY.md
    ├── PROJECT_SETUP_OPTIONS.md
    ├── MULTI_MAC_WORKFLOW.md    ← Multi-Mac setup guide
    └── auto-install.sh          ← Installation script
```

---

## 🗑️ Files Removed from Desktop:

These were duplicates or old versions, so they were deleted:
- ❌ BIOHACKLABS_CLAUDE.md (duplicate)
- ❌ CLAUDE.md (old version)
- ❌ CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md (old version)
- ❌ COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md (old version)
- ❌ CHEAT_SHEET.md (old version)

---

## ✅ Desktop is Now Clean!

Your Desktop should no longer have all those .md files cluttering it up.

---

## 📖 How to Access Documentation:

### **Quick Reference (Most Useful):**
```bash
open ~/Projects/lab-interpret/docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md
```

### **Main Setup Guide:**
```bash
open ~/Projects/lab-interpret/CLAUDE.md
```

### **Multi-Mac Workflow:**
```bash
open ~/Projects/lab-interpret/docs/MULTI_MAC_WORKFLOW.md
```

### **Browse All Docs:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/lab-interpret/docs
ls -la
```

---

## 🎯 Key Points:

1. ✅ **CLAUDE.md is in project root** - Claude Code will automatically read it
2. ✅ **All other docs in docs/** - Organized and accessible
3. ✅ **Desktop is clean** - No more clutter
4. ✅ **Synced via iCloud** - Available on all your Macs
5. ✅ **Easy access via symlink** - Just type `lab` to get there

---

## 🚀 Now You Can Start Building!

```bash
lab          # Jump to project
claude       # Start Claude Code
```

Or use the shortcut:
```bash
labcode      # Does both!
```

Inside Claude Code:
```
Read CLAUDE.md and show me the project structure
```

**Your Desktop is clean and your project is organized! 🎉**
