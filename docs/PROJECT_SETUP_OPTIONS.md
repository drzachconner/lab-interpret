# 🚀 BiohackLabs Project Setup Options

## Current Situation:
We couldn't find an existing interpret-labs or biohacklabs project in common locations.

---

## 🎯 What Would You Like To Do?

### **Option A: I Have the Project Already**
**Tell me the location**, and I'll:
1. Navigate there
2. Copy CLAUDE.md setup guide
3. Start Claude Code
4. Begin building features

**Where is it?** (Examples)
- `/Users/drzachconner/Desktop/interpret-labs`
- `/Users/drzachconner/Documents/my-projects/biohacklabs`
- Somewhere else?

---

### **Option B: Clone from GitHub**
**If it exists on GitHub**, give me the URL and I'll:
1. Clone it to `~/Projects/biohacklabs.ai`
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Copy CLAUDE.md setup guide
4. Start Claude Code

**What's the GitHub URL?**
- `https://github.com/yourusername/interpret-labs`
- `https://github.com/yourusername/biohacklabs`

---

### **Option C: Create New Next.js Project**
**Start fresh** with proper BiohackLabs setup:

I'll create:
```
~/Projects/biohacklabs.ai/
├── app/              # Next.js 14 app directory
├── components/       # React components
├── lib/             # Utilities & API clients
│   ├── supabase.ts
│   ├── openai.ts
│   └── fullscript.ts
├── types/           # TypeScript definitions
├── public/          # Static assets
├── CLAUDE.md        # Claude Code guide
├── .env.local       # Environment variables
├── package.json     # Dependencies
└── tsconfig.json    # TypeScript config
```

**Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript (Strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Database & Auth)
- OpenAI API (Lab interpretation)
- Fullscript API (Supplement recommendations)

---

### **Option D: Use Existing Project but Different Name**
**Maybe it's called something else?**

Common variations:
- `lab-test-interpreter`
- `medical-labs`
- `health-dashboard`
- `functional-medicine-app`

**What's it called?**

---

## 🤔 Not Sure?

Let me help you decide:

### **Choose Option A** if:
- You've already started building
- You have existing code
- You know where the files are

### **Choose Option B** if:
- It's on GitHub
- You want to work on it from scratch
- You have the repo URL

### **Choose Option C** if:
- Starting completely fresh
- Want proper Next.js 14 setup
- Want all best practices configured

### **Choose Option D** if:
- You have a project but different name
- It's for BiohackLabs but called something else
- Need help finding it

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide:

**Just tell me ONE of these:**

1. "It's at [path]" → I'll set it up there
2. "Clone from [GitHub URL]" → I'll clone it
3. "Create new project" → I'll scaffold it
4. "Search for [name]" → I'll find it

---

## 💡 My Recommendation:

**If you have ANY existing code:**
→ Find it and use Option A

**If it's on GitHub:**
→ Use Option B to clone it

**If starting totally fresh:**
→ Use Option C for best setup

## ⏱️ Time Estimates:

| Option | Time to Setup | Ready to Code |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| A - Existing | 2 min | Immediately |
| B - Clone | 5 min | After npm install |
| C - New | 10 min | Fully scaffolded |
| D - Search | 3 min | Once found |

---

**Which option works for you?**

Just reply with:
- Option A + path
- Option B + GitHub URL  
- Option C
- Option D + project name

Or just tell me in plain English and I'll figure it out! 🚀
