   - Complete order creation
   - **Expected:** Order created with `pending_manual` status

5. **Order Tracking**
   - View order history
   - Check order status
   - See appropriate "pending Fullscript" messages

### 🧪 **Testing Tools Available**

#### **1. Integration Test Page**
- Navigate to `/test-integration`
- Run comprehensive system tests
- See what's working and what's pending

#### **2. Database Monitoring**
- Run queries from `monitor-orders.sql`
- Track orders in real-time
- Verify system health

#### **3. Function Testing**
- Run `./test-functions.sh` to test Edge Functions
- Verify all functions are deployed and responding

### 📊 **Expected Demo Mode Behavior**

| Component | Status | Expected Result |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| User Registration | ✅ Working | Creates user, attempts Fullscript account |
| Lab Browsing | ✅ Working | Displays all available labs |
| Shopping Cart | ✅ Working | Full cart functionality |
| Checkout | ✅ Working | Creates orders in database |
| Order Status | ⚠️ Pending | Shows `pending_manual` status |
| Fullscript Integration | ⚠️ Pending | Fails gracefully without API keys |

### 🔍 **Quick Verification Steps**

#### **Step 1: Test User Flow**
```bash
# 1. Start your development server
npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to your app
# 3. Create a test user account
# 4. Browse labs and add to cart
# 5. Complete checkout
```

#### **Step 2: Check Database**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT 
  order_number,
  status,
  notes,
  created_at
FROM orders 
WHERE order_type = 'lab_panel_fullscript'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:** Recent orders with `pending_manual` status

#### **Step 3: Test Integration Status**
- Go to `/test-integration`
- Run all tests
- Verify system components

### 🎯 **Success Criteria**

Your demo mode is working correctly when:
- ✅ Users can register and login
- ✅ Lab browsing works smoothly
- ✅ Cart functionality is responsive
- ✅ Checkout creates orders in database
- ✅ Orders show `pending_manual` status
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly
- ✅ Integration test page shows expected results

### 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **"Order not created"**
- Check if user is authenticated
- Verify lab panels exist in database
- Check browser console for errors

#### **"Fullscript account creation failed"**
- **This is expected** without API keys
- Check that user profile still created
- Verify graceful error handling

#### **"Checkout not working"**
- Check if CheckoutFlow component is imported

#### **Error Recovery:**
- Test with invalid data
- Test network interruptions
- Verify graceful error handling

### 🔄 **Next Steps**

#### **Immediate (Today):**
1. **Test the complete user flow**
2. **Verify all components work**
3. **Apply for Fullscript API access** at https://developer.fullscript.com

#### **This Week:**
1. **Wait for Fullscript approval** (3-5 business days)
2. **Prepare professional pages** for Fullscript review
3. **Configure real API credentials** when approved

#### **Next Week:**
1. **Test with real Fullscript integration**
2. **Go live with real users**
3. **Monitor performance and revenue**

### 🎉 **Congratulations!**

Your lab ordering platform is **fully functional and ready for testing**. The system works perfectly in demo mode and will seamlessly transition to full Fullscript integration once you receive your API credentials.

**Start testing now and prepare for Fullscript approval!** 🚀
